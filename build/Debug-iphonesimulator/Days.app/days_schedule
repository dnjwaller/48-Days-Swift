<daynum>Introduction</daynum>
<content:encoded><p>Here\'92s where the rubber meets the road. This is not just another book to read; this is a process for putting you on track for meaningful, purposeful, and profitable work. Follow this step-by-step process and you\'92ll see your dreams come to life and experience the exhilarating joy of doing work that releases your passions and strongest abilities. Put yourself on this time schedule so you radically change your level of success if you have ever felt that your work is just a necessary exchange for a paycheck. Work through each step and keep moving even if you feel you could do more work on a particular step.\
Each day\'92s assignment refers to a section in the book. You may want to do a quick overview and read some of the examples of people who have dramatically changed their view of work as they found that sweet spot where work and play become indistinguishable. This is a process to get you through those inevitable and perhaps unwelcome transition points in your life.\
Check off each day\'92s activities as you complete them. See yourself getting closer and closer to the work you love. <b>
\i\b Start the countdown \'96 today is Day Number One.\

\i0 Here are some beginning tips for this process:\

\f2\b0  * 
\f1\b Talk to everyone; don\'92t be secretive. Tell people about your future plans. Sharing your ideas will help you believe they are reachable \'96 and it will re- enforce your commitment to making them a reality.\

\f2\b0  * 
\f1\b Integrate all material as you complete it. Each piece is important to accurately define the best opportunity for you.\

\f2\b0  * 
\f1\b This schedule is designed to take approximately 30 minutes each day for the next 48 Days. Be consistent about taking at least that much time each day. Don\'92t plan to just catch up on the weekends. The material will become more real if you digest a small portion each day.\

\f2\b0  * 
\f1\b Write out your responses to the 
\i Countdown to the Work I Love 
\i0 questions at the end of each chapter. Your plan will become more real if you are writing it out. Don\'92t just hope that general thinking will change your future. Without a clear plan you will repeat what you have already done.\

\f3 \'a5 \'a5 \'a5\

\f1 Skills & Abilities Personality Traits Values, Dreams & Passions\
The more you know about yourself in these three areas, the easier it will be to recognize work that fits you.\

You must include these in some form in your work \'96 otherwise it will be missing a critical element.\

\b 13.
\b0 _____ Be comfortable with this process of looking inward. Many people look outward too quickly and jump at what appears to be an opportunity only to discover\
six months down the road that it is not a fit. You are doing the important work now. 85% of the process of choosing the right career path comes as a result of looking inward. 15% is the application of what you then know about yourself in finding \'96 or creating \'96 work that fits.

\b 15.
\b0 _______ Now we\'92re getting to the \'93nuts and bolts.\'94 Read Chapter Six. Think through how your current resume 
\i sells 
\i0 you. Does it position you for what you want to continue doing, or is it just a historical overview of what you\'92ve done? Explore whether a chronological or a functional resume will serve you best.\

\b 16.
\b0 _____ Create your resume. List your Skills & Abilities -- Skill areas could include: Sales and Marketing, Administration, Budgeting, Computer Programming, Customer Service, Mechanical Ability, Accounting, Supervising, Graphic Design, Counseling, Training, Writing, Organization, etc. Use the

So now build your list of 30-40 organizations where there would be a potential match for your areas of competence. Spend two hours with your city directory or a national business search engine, where you can get a brief company history and profile, and the names of proper contact people.\

\b 20.
\b0 _____ Start the clock on your Job Search. Compose your 
\b Introductory & Cover Letters
\b0 . Use the samples found in the Appendix to shape your own. Now complete the 
\i\b Countdown to the Work I Love

\b 21._____ 
\b0 Send first 15-20 introductory letters. Track your repeated contact and progress for each company.\

\b0 Begin 
\b Phone Follow-Up on 1st R\'e9sum\'e9s
\b0 . Begin to schedule interviews. Remember how critical this is. Your statistical odds of getting a job offer just from sending out r\'e9sum\'e9s is 1 out of 254. Add an actual phone contact to that, and it jumps to 1 out of 15!. You are better off to send out 35 resumes and to follow-up than to send out 1000 where all you do is wait.
