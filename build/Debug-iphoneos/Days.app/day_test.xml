<daynum>Introduction</daynum>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here's where the rubber meets the road. This is not just another book to read, this is a process for putting you on track for meaningful, purposeful, and profitable work. Follow this step-by-step process and you'll see your dreams come to life and experience the exhilarating joy of doing work that releases your passions and strongest abilities. Put yourself on this time schedule so you radically change your level of success if you have ever felt that your work is just a necessary exchange for a paycheck. Work through each step and keep moving even if you feel you could do more work on a particular step.  Each day's assignment refers to a section in the book. You may want to do a quick overview and read some of the examples of people who have dramatically changed their view of work as they found that sweet spot where work and play become indistinguishable. This is a process to get you through those inevitable and perhaps unwelcome transition points in your life.  Check off each day's activities as you complete them. See yourself getting closer and closer to the work you love. 
<br><b>Start the countdown - today is Day Number One.

Here are some beginning tips for this process:
<br><ul>
<li>Talk to everyone; don't be secretive. Tell people about your future plans. Sharing your ideas will help you believe they are reachable and it will re- enforce your commitment to making them a reality.
<li>Integrate all material as you complete it. Each piece is important to accurately define the best opportunity for you.
<li>This schedule is designed to take approximately 30 minutes each day for the next 48 Days. Be consistent about taking at least that much time each day. Don\'92t plan to just catch up on the weekends. The material will become more real if you digest a small portion each day.
<li>Write out your responses to the <i> Countdown to the Work I Love </i> questions at the end of each chapter. Your plan will become more real if you are writing it out. Don't just hope that general thinking will change your future. Without a clear plan you will repeat what you have already done.
